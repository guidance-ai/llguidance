# Low-level Guidance (llguidance)

This library implements constrained decoding (also called constrained sampling or
structured outputs) for Large Langauge Models (LLMs).
It can enforce arbitrary context-free grammar on the output of LLM
and is fast (on the order of 1ms of CPU time per token
(for 100k tokenizer) with negligible startup costs).

Following grammar formats are supported:
- `llguidance` - [internal (JSON-based) format](./parser/src/api.rs)
- regular expressions (following Rust regex crate [syntax](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax))
- a large subset of JSON schemas (but see [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/llguidance/issues/44))
- context-free grammars in (a [subset](./parser/src/lark/README.md) of) [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) format

The internal format is most powerful and can be generated by the following libraries:
- [Guidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance) (Python)
- [guidance.ts](https://github.com/mmoskal/guidance-ts) (TypeScript)
- hopefully more to come!

The library can be used from:
- [Rust](./parser/README.md), [sample](./sample_parser/src/sample_parser.rs)
- [C and C++](./parser/llguidance.h), [sample](./c_sample/c_sample.cpp)
- [Python](./python/llguidance/_lib.pyi)

The library is currently integrated in:
- [Guidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance) - library for interacting with LLMs;
  uses either llama.cpp or HF Tranformers
- [LLGTRT](https://github.com/guidance-ai/llgtrt) - OpenAI-compatible REST server using NVIDIA's [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM)

The integration is ongoing in:
- onnxruntime-genai - [draft PR](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-genai/pull/1038)
- mistral.rs - [preliminary PR](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/mistral.rs/pull/899)
- llama.cpp - [preliminary PR](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/10224);
  note that llama.cpp is fully integrated in Guidance above
  via Python bindings

## Technical details

Given a context-free grammar, a tokenizer, and prefix of tokens,
llguidance computes a token mask (set of tokens from the tokenizer)
that when added to current prefix of token can lead to a valid string in
the language of the grammar.
Computing a mask takes on the order of 1ms of single-core CPU time 
for a tokenizer with 100k tokens.
While this depends on the exact grammar, it holds eg. for grammars resulting from JSON schemas.
There is also no significant startup cost.

The library implements a context-free grammar parser with Earley's algorithm
on top of a lexer which uses [derivatives of regular expressions](https://github.com/microsoft/derivre).
A lot of
[low-level optimizations](https://github.com/microsoft/toktrie/blob/main/implementation.md)
are implemented.

## Building

- [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install); 1.75 or later

If you just need the C or Rust library (`llguidance_parser`), 
check the [parser](./parser/README.md) directory.

For Python bindings:

- install python 3.9 or later; very likely you'll need a virtual env/conda
- run `./scripts/install-deps.sh`
- to build and after any changes, run `./scripts/test-guidance.sh`

This builds the Python bindings for the library and runs the tests
(which mostly live in the Guidance repo - it will clone it).
